    About
</div>
<div class="SectionText">
    My goal with this site is to use as few third party tools as possible.  I do use product libraries like Telerik
    and obout regularly for professional projects.  However, I feel that doing as much as possible without them
    will provide a better learning experience.  Then if I do use third party tools for work related projects, I
    will be able to use them more effectively because I have a better base understanding of how the code works.

<div class="SectionText">
    This site is coded using ASP.NET MVC, C# and jQuery.  The database is MySQL.  Since this is a personal site
    I am using HTML5 and am not trying to support older browser versions.  The top menu data is read from an XML file.
    I felt it would be easier to manipulate the menu for a small site via XML rather than creating database structures.

    Future Plans
</div>
<div class="SectionText">
    <div style="font-weight:bold;">Contact Page</div>
    <div>Add a basic form to allow website visitors to contact me.</div>
    <br/>
    <div style="font-weight:bold;">Database Script Download/Backup</div>
    <div>
        Add links to download all of the scripts needed to create the database structures as well as the database data.
        This will serve two purposes: one, allow people to see how I've created the database structures, and two, serve
        as a kind of extra backup incase I need it.
    </div>
    <br/>
    <div style="font-weight:bold;">Recipe Images</div>
    <div>Add support for uploading and viewing images for each recipe.</div>
    <br />
    <div style="font-weight:bold;">Recipe Download</div>
    <div>Add a way to download recipes, probably in the form of a PDF document.</div>
    <br />
    <div style="font-weight:bold;">Better site design</div>
    <div>
        I'm more of a developer than a designer.  Right now I'm focused more on functionality.
        Over time I'm sure I'll be able to improve the site design.
